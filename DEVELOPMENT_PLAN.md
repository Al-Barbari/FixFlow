# FixFlow v1 Development Plan

## Project Overview
FixFlow is a VS Code extension that helps developers track, manage, and resolve technical debt directly within their coding environment. The extension provides an option to either store debt data locally or upload it to GitHub via a project root file.

## Core Architecture Decisions

### Storage Strategy
- **Local Storage**: Default `.fixflow/debts.json` file in project root
- **GitHub Integration**: Optional `.fixflow/debts.json` file that gets committed and pushed to GitHub
- **User Choice**: Developer decides during setup whether to enable GitHub integration

### Data Structure
- All debt data stored in `.fixflow/debts.json`
- File structure: `{ "debts": [...], "metadata": {...}, "settings": {...} }`
- Each debt includes file path, line range, and GitHub integration metadata

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure

### 1.2 Configuration Service
- **File**: `src/services/config-service.ts`
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Manage user preferences (GitHub integration, auto-scan, etc.)
  - Handle workspace-specific settings
  - Validate configuration options

### 1.3 GitHub Integration Service
- **File**: `src/services/github-service.ts`
